Here is the poem translated into English:

Somewhere, in a blue and deep heart,
An old dream always grows.
A peace like that, which isn't just a rush,
But a spirit of freedom that blows and flourishes.

Without hate or a wall in the heart,
Without wounding words and pain.
Just an outstretched hand, a smile of hope,
A sweet quiet, a true and humble love.

Birds fly in open skies,
Children play without fears.
Flowers bloom in every corner,
And a light of hope fills the garden.

So we will sing together, a great and clear voice,
A song of peace, of reconciliation and of a border.
May we live together in tenderness and calmness,
Because only then will a more complete world come, maybe in a moment.
